# GigaSnake

[My Notes](notes.md)

A competitive game, based on classic Snake, where each player controls a snake and wins by becoming the largest before elimination. Snakes grow by colliding with randomly appearing fruit. Elimination happens if a snake collides with itself, a wall, or another snake.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Based on the classis video game Snake, GigaSnake is an online multiplayer game where each player is competing to get the largest snake before death. Each player in a game will be playing on the same board. Collision with the edges of the board or a snake (including one's own snake) will cause a death. A player's score upon death is how long the snake grew, and therefore how much fruit it ate. Players will need to create an account so their high scores can be recorded.

### Design

### Key features

- Users will be prompted to create an account or login upon loading the game.
- Once logged in, users can create a joinable game or join an existing one. Users can join a game with its identifier: a four digit code chosen upon game creation.
- Gameplay then follows on a 64x64 grid for each player's snake to navigate. The lower portion of the screen has arrowkey buttons to move the snake.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic page structure and navigation
- **CSS** - Styling the various pages to fit different screen sizes and look good.
- **React** - provide login, create/join games, and arrowkey controls.
- **Service** - saves high scores and allows for online play.
- **DB/Login** - High score and User login storage.
- **WebSocket** - running scores of all players, joinable game hosting.
